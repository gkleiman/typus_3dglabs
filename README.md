# Typus: Admin interface for Rails applications

## Installing

Install from GitHub the latest version which it's compatible with Rails 2.3.5.

    $ script/plugin install git://github.com/fesplugas/typus.git

Once `typus` is installed, run the generator to create required files 
and migrate your database.

    $ script/generate typus
    $ rake db:migrate

To create the first user, start the application server, go to 
http://0.0.0.0:3000/admin and follow the instructions.

## Namespaced Models?

If you want to be able to use `delayed_job` you need to add the following 
two lines to your `config/routes.rb` file.

    map.connect "admin/delayed/jobs/:action/:id", :controller => "admin/delayed/jobs"
    map.connect "admin/delayed/jobs/:action/:id.:format", :controller => "admin/delayed/jobs"

And then create and configure `config/typus/delayed_job.yml` and 
`config/typus/delayed_job_roles.yml` as you do with your other models.

    # config/typus/delayed_job.yml
    Delayed::Job:
      fields:
        list: ...
        form: ...
      search: ...

    # config/typus/delayed_job_roles.yml
    admin:
      Delayed::Job: all
